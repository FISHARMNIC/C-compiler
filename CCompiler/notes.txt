- fix "*" and "&" having to be used as "x" and "AND" in eq()
- add undefined integer and char types: "int jon;"
- ***IMPORTANT*** finish if statements
- assembly functions currently return integers
- finish input
- fix "if" "else if" "else" statements having to be formatted specifically 
- fix inline function calls for while statments "while(get_char() != 'A')"
- fix function pointers needing to be passed with "&" 
- add variadic functions
- ***IMPORTANT*** cannot define string arrays like |char name[] = "..."| in functions
- ***IMPORTANT*** cannot define undefined integers in functions like "int jon;"
- add sizeof pointer
- add comparing char arrays with bytes. currently compares extended registers, only compare low registers instead
- add running functions inside of eq()
- ***IMPORTANT*** add structs (already started)
- ***IMPORTANT*** Cannot return pointers
